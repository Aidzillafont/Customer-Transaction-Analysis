# Customer Transaction Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based analysis of customer transactions for a retail store. The analysis focuses on three key areas:

1. Clustering and identifying customer groups for targeted marketing campaigns
2. Collaborative filtering to recommend items to customers based on their similarity to other customers
3. Frequent itemset mining to identify pairs of items that often occur together in customer baskets, which can be used to optimize store placement
